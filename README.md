# CS-Code-Q1
## General infos
This has been the entire codebase of my intensive class in computer science in the 11th grade (named Q1 in German Highschools/Gymansium, hence the name). 
As this is now an archive, some features will still be used to review acquired materials, but there won't be any major contributions.

These are all the major topics that are included in the 11th grade intensive class curriculum of the German federal state of North-Rhine-Westphalia (Gymnasium-Level).

## Topics covered

Over the course of this year the main topics convered included: 

### Imperative and Object-Oriented Programming with Java 


### Linear Datastructures and their implementations:

#### Lists 
A custom implementation of a Single-Linked-List, as well as some minor programming applications and testscenarions

#### Queues & Stacks
Also a quite simple implementation, along with some small test code

### Binary Trees
Here topics such as the implementation, as well as editing and traversal have been practiced 

### Graphs 
A very small Graph class, along with some (not completely optimal) implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm


## About the structure 
Each minor assignment has its own folder, that is usually denoted with the week (LWx, where x denotes the week) as well as some keywords.
Some major projects, especially latter ones also include a small maven build file for better usability and overall ease of use and execution.
